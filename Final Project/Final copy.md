# Data Analysis for Final Project

### The goal is to implement all the aspects we learned in class so far and analyze it with our understanding.
### The data comprised of 2 types of bikes which were either Mountain or Road. Those 2 bikes belonged to different models and made of different frames. One of my main goals of this data analysis was analyzing different categories and model and frames and see which is the most expensive one and which one seems to be the cheapest one.

## Questions I focused were as follows:

#### 1. which bike is  most expensive in category 1?
#### 2. which bike is least expensive in category 1?
#### 3. which frame is most expensive carbon or alumunium?
#### 4. which frame is least expensive carbon or alumunium?
#### 5. which is least expensive in category 2?
#### 6. which is most expensive in category 2 ?

### After my data analysis I conducted and with also the help of box plot diagrams my conclusion is as follows:

#### The average price for Mountain is 4255 while the average price for Road bike is 3619.
#### The expensive bike in category 1 are both Mountain and Road with the price of 12790.
#### The cheapest bike in category 1 is Mountain with the price of 415.
#### The summary shows,In model Cross Country Race and Elite Road are the most expensive one sharing the same price of 12790.
#### However the cheapest one is Sport Bike.
#### The summary shows,In Frame Carbon the most expensive one withe price of 12790.
#### However the cheapest one is Alumunium Bike frame.
